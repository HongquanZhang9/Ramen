  A folder store a .ipynb file which shows all the visualizations we generated in the presentation.



## Run the code

#### There are two methods to run the code.

- #### **Run .ipynb file**

  To see the results (or figures) in the project, visit ***figures/figures.ipynb***, and run each code cell in the ***figures.ipynb*** file. Then the results will show up.

- #### **Run source code**

  If you are interested in the source code and want to see some intermediate results, please visit the **src** folder and run **.py files** by the terminal or IDE you use. For example, you can open  the ***src/dataLoader.py*** file which contains a DataLoader class, free feel to create a DataLoader object and try some methods with the help of the comments.
